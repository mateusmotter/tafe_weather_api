This project has been developed for the Web Data unit for TAFE QLD - Intake 6 2023

Project Scenario:

"You are employed by Uptown IT as a Software/Web Developer. You have been assigned to a new project and your task is to develop a MongoDB REST API to interact with a large dataset of raw climate data. 

The client for this project is an educational institution that wants to use raw climate data to run student projects to analyse climate data collected in areas QLD using a distributed Internet of Things Sensor network 

The Interface for interacting with this data needs to be a RESTful Web API that will be developed to suit the data stored in the database, the functionality required around accessing and manipulating this data, and Authentication and Authorisation of requests. 

The database must include a collection of Weather Data, as well as a collection of Users. The Users collection will be designed to store Authentication and Authorisation information for a user account that is used to interact with the RESTful Web API 

The client has indicated that they will be designing their own client to interact with the developed RESTful Web API, and require all of the functionality outlined in this document to be provided through the API, including API documentation to allow for easily generating a client in a given language. The language and framework used to design the RESTful Web API is not important to the client, as long as conventions are followed when designing the API."

NodeJS was used to perform the HTTP calls through the stablished endpoints.
